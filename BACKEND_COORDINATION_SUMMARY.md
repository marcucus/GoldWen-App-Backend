# Backend Coordination with Frontend - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The backend has been completely coordinated with the frontend requirements as specified in `FRONTEND_BACKEND_PROCESSES.md`. All necessary features have been implemented to ensure seamless communication between the Flutter frontend and the NestJS backend.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. WebSocket Real-time Chat (`ws://localhost:3000/chat`)
- **File**: `src/modules/chat/chat.gateway.ts`
- **Features**: 
  - JWT authentication for WebSocket connections
  - Room-based messaging (conversations)
  - Typing indicators (`start_typing`, `stop_typing`)
  - Message read receipts
  - Real-time notifications
  - User presence management

### 2. Photo Upload System
- **Files**: `src/modules/profiles/profiles.controller.ts`, `profiles.service.ts`, `profiles.module.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Multipart file upload with validation
  - File size limits (10MB max)
  - Format validation (JPEG, PNG only)
  - Automatic storage in `uploads/photos/`
  - Primary photo management
  - Maximum 6 photos per profile

### 3. External Matching Service Integration
- **File**: `src/modules/matching/matching-integration.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Integration with Python FastAPI service (`http://localhost:8000`)
  - Compatibility calculation API calls
  - Daily selection generation
  - Batch compatibility processing
  - Graceful fallback when service is unavailable
  - Health check monitoring

### 4. Enhanced Daily Selection Process
- **File**: `src/modules/matching/matching.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automated daily selection generation (cron job at 12:00 PM)
  - Integration with external matching service
  - User preference filtering
  - Fallback to local algorithm when external service fails
  - Subscription-based selection limits

### 5. FCM Push Notification System
- **File**: `src/modules/notifications/fcm.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Device token management
  - Push notifications for daily selections, matches, messages
  - Topic-based broadcasting
  - Platform-specific notification formatting (iOS/Android)
  - Notification templates for different event types

### 6. API Endpoints Compliance
All endpoints from `API_ROUTES.md` are implemented and match the specifications:
- ‚úÖ Authentication routes (register, login, social login, password reset)
- ‚úÖ User management routes
- ‚úÖ Profile management with photo uploads
- ‚úÖ Matching system routes
- ‚úÖ Chat and messaging routes
- ‚úÖ Subscription management structure
- ‚úÖ Notification routes
- ‚úÖ Admin routes

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
A sample `.env` file has been created with all necessary environment variables:
- Database configuration
- JWT secrets
- OAuth credentials (optional in development)
- External service URLs
- Notification service keys

### Development Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure environment variables in `.env`
3. Start the application: `npm run start:dev`
4. Access API documentation at: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Alignment

The backend now perfectly aligns with the frontend architecture described in `FRONTEND_BACKEND_PROCESSES.md`:

- **API Principal**: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1` ‚úÖ
- **WebSocket Chat**: `ws://localhost:3000/chat` ‚úÖ
- **External Matching Service**: Integration ready for `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Ready for Frontend Integration

The backend is now fully coordinated and ready for the Flutter frontend to connect. All the processes described in `FRONTEND_BACKEND_PROCESSES.md` are supported:

- User registration and authentication flows
- Profile creation and photo management
- Daily selection and matching processes
- Real-time chat and messaging
- Push notifications
- Subscription management

## üìù Notes

1. **OAuth Configuration**: Google and Apple OAuth strategies are optional in development mode
2. **Database**: Requires PostgreSQL and Redis for full functionality
3. **External Services**: Matching service integration includes fallback mechanisms
4. **File Storage**: Photos are stored locally in `uploads/photos/` directory
5. **WebSockets**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests

The implementation follows NestJS best practices with proper error handling, logging, validation, and documentation.
